# app-etite
This would be a simple CRUD app designed for teams, classmates and different social groups. The app would let you create a post of what you want for lunchâ€¦then people in your group can see that and potentially like or comment on that post. Also whoever liked the post gets a notification when everyone is going out to get that said item.


"Hello and welcome to our page! App-etite is a webapp dedicated to finding out which lunch is the best in an uncertain world. Post your lunches, vote on which you think is tastiest. DOWN VOTE YOUR ENEMIES. Do you think your food has what it takes?"
