# app-etite
This would be a simple CRUD app designed for teams, classmates and different social groups. The app would let you create a post of what you want for lunchâ€¦then people in your group can see that and potentially like or comment on that post. Also whoever liked the post gets a notification when everyone is going out to get that said item.
